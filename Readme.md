(Will be keeping in lock step with latest version of dotnet)

## Frontend
### NPM Latest
### React

### UI Libraries

Aceternity UI - https://ui.aceternity.com/components

shadcn/ui - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs

#### Base Underlying Frameworks

Framer Motion - https://www.framer.com/motion/

Radix UI - https://www.radix-ui.com/

Tailwind CSS - https://tailwindcss.com/


The reason why we are primarily leaning on Aceternity UI and shadcn/ui is due to their ability to provide us their 
component source as opposed to locking us into having to use components and only manipulate them via props and 
overriding CSS (which is always a hairy situation). Aceternity and shadcn are built ontop of Framer motion 
(provides awesome motion capabilities), Radix UI (an accessibility friendly component library) and tailwind css 
(which styles the components without having to be 100% burried in CSS).
